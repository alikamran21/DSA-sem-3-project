DSA Semester Project — Behavioral Anomaly Detection

Contributor Summary (Ali’s Contribution)

Primary Responsibilities & Contributions

1. Core Data Structures Implementation

Designed and coded custom modules in pure C++:

array_handler.cpp/h – manages user task logs using dynamic arrays.

circular_queue.cpp/h – tracks most recent user actions in real time.

pointer_utils.cpp/h – monitors memory allocation, deallocation, and pointer diagnostics.

Demonstrated pointer arithmetic, dynamic allocation, and O(1) access operations in all modules.

2. Integration & Architecture

Integrated array and queue systems into a unified main.cpp test driver.

Connected modules through PointerUtils for live memory tracking.

Ensured safe allocation/deallocation and verified pointer validity.

3. Testing & Validation

Built and executed independent test cases for each module.

Verified enqueue/dequeue operations, overflow/underflow handling, and circular overwriting behavior.

Confirmed all array functions handled boundary conditions gracefully.

4. Performance & Complexity Analysis

Measured and documented function complexities (O(1) / O(n)).

Analyzed runtime behavior of queue and array modules under stress tests.

Contributed data for the final complexity report.

5. Documentation & Deliverables

Added detailed inline comments across all files.

Prepared and maintained the integration and contribution log.

Helped format the final short report and submission content.

Summary of Impact

Developed and maintained the core system-level logic ensuring data-structure integrity, efficient storage, retrieval, and memory tracking for behavioral data in the anomaly-detection simulation.
