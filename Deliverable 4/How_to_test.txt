1. Compile the new tools:

g++ src/bio_trainer.cpp src/avl_profile.cpp -I include -o bio_trainer
g++ src/bio_monitor.cpp src/avl_profile.cpp -I include -o bio_monitor

2. Train (Do this first):

Run: sudo ./bio_trainer

Type normally for 30 seconds.

Move your mouse around in circles.

Press ESC to stop.

Result: It creates bio_fingerprints.csv.

3. Monitor (The Test):

Run: sudo ./bio_monitor

Type normally: It should say [OK] Key match.

Simulate an Intruder:

Start mashing keys incredibly fast (like a script).

Or type painfully slow (like someone who doesn't know the layout).

Yank the mouse violently.

Result: The Threat Level will rise. Once it hits 20, the VM shuts down.



cat /proc/bus/input/devices

Look for "Keyboard": Note the H: Handlers=sysrq kbd event<X> (e.g., event1).

Look for "Mouse": Note the H: Handlers=mouse0 event<Y> (e.g., event2).

Example: If Keyboard is event1 and Mouse is event2, remember those numbers.
